## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

- [Position property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - Before this project, I had little knowledge when it comes to using the position property. Although, I plan on increasing my understanding of this css layout. I feel like this is a very powerful styling property and when mastered, will help me become a better front-end developer.
