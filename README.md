## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

- [Position property](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) - Before this project, I had little knowledge when it comes to using the position property. Although, I plan on increasing my understanding of this css layout. I feel like this is a very powerful styling property and when mastered, will help me become a better front-end developer.

## Acknowledgement

- Danilo Blas - [@Sdann26](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/Sdann26) - I was having trouble making the view icon fully visible on hover and Danilo proposed a solution that fixes my problem and suggested that I leave the opacity at 1 on `hidden:hover` class but changing the background using the `alpha` option which gives the background transparency.

```css
hsla(178.1, 100%, 50%, 0.5);
```

**The value 'a' (alpha) in [hsla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsla) is to give it opacity.**
